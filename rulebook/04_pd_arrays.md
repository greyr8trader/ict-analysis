# PD Arrays — Fair Value Gap (Imbalance)

## Definition
- A Fair Value Gap (FVG) forms when price moves in one direction without candle overlap.

## Identification
- The FVG is defined by:
  - The high of the candle prior to the impulsive move, and
  - The low of the candle following the impulsive move.

## Usage
- After a structure break, price OFTEN retraces into the FVG.
- Entries SHOULD be taken as price trades back into the FVG.
- For index futures, lower timeframes (1–3 minute) are preferred for identifying FVGs.
