# PD Arrays — Fair Value Gap (Imbalance)

## Definition
- A Fair Value Gap (FVG) forms when price moves in one direction without candle overlap.

## Identification
- The FVG is defined by:
  - The high of the candle prior to the impulsive move, and
  - The low of the candle following the impulsive move.

## Usage
- After a structure break, price OFTEN retraces into the FVG.
- Entries SHOULD be taken as price trades back into the FVG.
- For index futures, lower timeframes (1–3 minute) are preferred for identifying FVGs.

## Fair Value Gap (FVG) — Intraday Confirmation

- An FVG is confirmed after an MSS when the next candle fails to fully overlap.
- Entries SHOULD be taken as price retraces into the FVG.
- For indices, FVGs are best identified on 3m, 2m, or 1m charts.

## FVG Requirement

- A valid setup REQUIRES a Fair Value Gap to form after the MSS.
- If no FVG forms, the setup is INVALID.
- Price MAY retrace into the same FVG multiple times.
