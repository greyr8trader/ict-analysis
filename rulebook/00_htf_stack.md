# HTF Stack (D + H1 + M15 → M5)

## Daily (D) — Macro Context
- Mark obvious external liquidity: prior daily highs/lows visible in dataset.
- Determine where price is likely drawing next: nearest meaningful BSL/SSL.
- Note if current price is in premium/discount of the Daily dealing range (if definable).

## H1 — Primary Narrative
- Define the H1 dealing range (most relevant swing low → swing high).
- Identify liquidity pools (clear swing highs/lows).
- Bias must be based on:
  1) liquidity raid (BSL/SSL)
  2) displacement
  3) MSS confirmation (H1 or M15)
- If no displacement: bias = neutral.

## M15 — Refinement
- Confirm narrative with a clean sequence:
  - sweep → displacement → MSS
- Mark 1–2 key PD arrays (M15 FVG/imbalance) that align with H1 bias.

## M5 — Execution Only
Execution model must be conditional:
1) raid local liquidity (M5)
2) displacement
3) M5 MSS
4) entry at M5 FVG in discount (long) or premium (short)
5) invalidation: below raid low (long) / above raid high (short) OR below/above displacement origin.
