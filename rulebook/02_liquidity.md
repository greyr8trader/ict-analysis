# Liquidity Rules

## Definitions
- Buy-side liquidity resides above old highs (buy stops).
- Sell-side liquidity resides below old lows (sell stops).

## Core Principles
- Price MUST draw toward liquidity or toward an imbalance.
- Before a significant move in the expected direction, price OFTEN runs opposing-side stops.
- Liquidity runs are used to induce traders into the wrong side of the market.

## Consolidation Behavior
- After consolidation, price OFTEN breaks first in one direction to induce entries,
  then reverses to attack the opposing liquidity pool.
- Relative equal highs or equal lows SHOULD be treated as identifiable liquidity pools.
