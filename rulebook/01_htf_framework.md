# HTF Framework (Weekly → Daily → Intraday)

## Weekly Bias
- The Weekly timeframe MUST be used to establish directional bias.
- Weekly bias is an expectation of expansion (higher or lower), NOT a prediction of the weekly close.

## Daily Context
- The Daily timeframe MUST be used to identify swing highs, swing lows, and liquidity pools.
- Daily levels provide the primary draw on price during the week.

## Intraday Alignment
- Intraday execution MUST align with Weekly bias and Daily liquidity context.
- Not every session MUST be traded; one high-quality setup is sufficient.

## Intraday Workflow
- Intraday analysis MUST begin on the 5-minute chart.
- Lower timeframes MAY be used only after higher-timeframe context is established.
