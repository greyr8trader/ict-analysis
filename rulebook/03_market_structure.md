# Market Structure (Break in Structure)

## Definition
- A Break in Market Structure (BMS) occurs when a short-term swing high or swing low is violated.

## Bearish Context
- In a bearish environment:
  - Price SHOULD run buy-side liquidity first.
  - A valid setup REQUIRES a break below a short-term swing low on a lower timeframe.

## Sequence Requirement
- Liquidity interaction MUST occur before a structure break is used for execution logic.

## Intraday Market Structure Shift (MSS)

- For intraday trading, MSS MUST be used instead of “Market Structure Break.”
- An intraday MSS implies a likely intraday draw, NOT a multi-day move.
- An MSS is valid ONLY AFTER liquidity has been taken.
- A candle DOES NOT need to close beyond a level to confirm an intraday MSS.
- MSS significance depends entirely on prior liquidity interaction.

## MSS Preconditions
- An intraday MSS MUST occur after liquidity is taken.
- Without an MSS, no trade is valid, even if liquidity is present.
- Traders MUST wait for a clear violation of a short-term swing; assumptions are INVALID.
