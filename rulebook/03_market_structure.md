# Market Structure (Break in Structure)

## Definition
- A Break in Market Structure (BMS) occurs when a short-term swing high or swing low is violated.

## Bearish Context
- In a bearish environment:
  - Price SHOULD run buy-side liquidity first.
  - A valid setup REQUIRES a break below a short-term swing low on a lower timeframe.

## Sequence Requirement
- Liquidity interaction MUST occur before a structure break is used for execution logic.
