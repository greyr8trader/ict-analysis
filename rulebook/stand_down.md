# Stand Down (No Trade) Conditions

Mark bias as Neutral and avoid active execution triggers when:
- No clear external liquidity draw from D/H1
- No sweep is present on M15/H1
- No displacement after sweep
- No MSS confirmation (M15 or M5)

If Neutral:
- Provide only conditional scenarios (If bullish confirmation occurs → long model; If bearish confirmation occurs → short model).
