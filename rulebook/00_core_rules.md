# Core Rules (ICT 2022)

- Narrative starts on higher timeframe (1H for this system).
- Identify dealing range and current premium/discount.
- Mark obvious liquidity pools: equal highs/lows, swing highs/lows.
- Look for displacement (strong move) that creates imbalance (FVG).
- Use PD arrays (FVG/OB) as areas of interest for entries.
- Execution is on 5M: wait for MSS + displacement into/away from PD arrays.
- Always define invalidation and what would flip bias.
