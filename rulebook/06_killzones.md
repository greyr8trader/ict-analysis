# Killzones & Session Liquidity

## Time Reference
- All session times MUST be referenced in New York local time.

## Sessions
- Asia Session: 7:00 PM – 9:00 PM
- London Session: 2:00 AM – 5:00 AM
- New York Session: 7:00 AM – 10:00 AM

## Key Levels
- Session highs and lows MUST be treated as liquidity reference points.
- Intraday highs/lows forming just before 9:30 AM (equities open) are significant.

## Execution Window
- Preferred execution window is 8:30 AM – 11:00 AM NY time.
- Trading after 12:00 PM NY time SHOULD be avoided for this model.

## Usage
- Expect session highs/lows to be swept to engineer liquidity.
- MSS and FVG setups are favored immediately after a session liquidity sweep.
