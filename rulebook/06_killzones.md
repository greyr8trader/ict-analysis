# Killzones & Session Liquidity

## Time Reference
- All session times MUST be referenced in New York local time.

## Sessions
- Asia Session: 7:00 PM – 9:00 PM
- London Session: 2:00 AM – 5:00 AM
- New York Session: 7:00 AM – 10:00 AM
- If current time is outside all defined killzones, killzone context must be marked as "Not Active"and used for historical reference only.

## Key Levels
- Session highs and lows MUST be treated as liquidity reference points.
- Intraday highs/lows forming just before 9:30 AM (equities open) are significant.

## Execution Window
- Preferred execution window is 8:30 AM – 11:00 AM NY time.
- Trading after 12:00 PM NY time SHOULD be avoided for this model.

## Usage
- Expect session highs/lows to be swept to engineer liquidity.
- MSS and FVG setups are favored immediately after a session liquidity sweep.

## Daily Session Layout (Indices)

- All session timing MUST be referenced in New York local time.

### Morning Session
- The morning trading window begins at 8:30 AM NY time.
- Morning trading is preferred from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM,
  with preference to be positioned before ~11:00 AM.

### New York Lunch (No-Trade)
- 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM NY time is a NO-TRADE window.
- While learning this model, traders MUST NOT trade this window even in demo.

### Afternoon Session
- The earliest preferred afternoon execution time is 1:30 PM NY time.
- After 1:30 PM, look for the first swing high and swing low of the afternoon session.
- Afternoon moves often accelerate into the close.

## Time Priority (Professional Lens)

- Time of day MUST be treated as a primary variable in price delivery.
- Specific times of day tend to produce volatility expansion and short-term reversals.
- Time-based charts are required for this model because algorithms operate under time.
