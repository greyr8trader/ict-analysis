# Dealing Range & Equilibrium

## Range Construction
- The current dealing range is defined by the session high and session low.

## Equilibrium
- The 50% level of the range represents equilibrium.
- Above the 50% level is premium.
- Below the 50% level is discount.

## Directional Use
- In bearish conditions:
  - Shorts SHOULD be taken in premium.
  - Targets SHOULD favor discount.

## Intraday Dealing Range
- The intraday dealing range MUST be defined by the session low-to-high.
- The 50% level of this range represents equilibrium.
- In bearish conditions:
  - Targets SHOULD be below the 50% level.
- Traders do NOT need to capture the entire range for a valid outcome.

## Daily Range Design (Indices)

- The trading day should be framed as:
  - A morning move,
  - A New York lunch pause/consolidation,
  - An afternoon continuation or reversal.

- Traders SHOULD study whether the afternoon:
  - Continues the morning direction, OR
  - Reverses the morning direction.

- A measured move MAY occur where the afternoon duplicates the morning range expansion.
