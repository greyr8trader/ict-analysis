# Futures Contract Selection (Index Futures)

## Delivery Months
- Index futures trade in quarterly contracts only:
  - March (H), June (M), September (U), December (Z).

## Expiration
- Expiration occurs on the third Friday of the delivery month.
- Traders MUST avoid trading expired contracts.

## Liquidity / Open Interest Rule
- Traders MUST trade the contract month with the highest open interest (largest liquidity pool).
- Approximately one week prior to expiration, traders SHOULD monitor open interest
  and roll to the contract with greater open interest as liquidity shifts.
