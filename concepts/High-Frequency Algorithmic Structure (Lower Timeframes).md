High-Frequency Algorithmic Structure (Lower Timeframes)
Canonical Definition

High-frequency algorithmic structure refers to the use of very short-term market structure (1m–3m and sub-minute) to engineer liquidity and delivery.

Identification Criteria

Swing highs/lows on 1m–3m charts.

Rapid stop runs followed by immediate reversals.

Frequent Fair Value Gap formation.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

High-frequency algorithms operate primarily on 1m–3m and sub-minute intervals.

Structural signals on these timeframes are valid only in proper liquidity context.

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Lower timeframe precision is a refinement, not a replacement, for higher-timeframe bias.

Validity Conditions

Requires alignment with session timing and liquidity conditions.

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

What This Concept Is NOT

Not indicator-based scalping.

Not volume-based analysis.

Ambiguities / Conflicts

Exact sub-minute intervals are referenced but not formalized.
