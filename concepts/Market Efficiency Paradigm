Market Efficiency Paradigm
Canonical Definition

The Market Efficiency Paradigm describes price delivery as an algorithmic process that seeks opposing liquidity to efficiently rebalance buy-side and sell-side participation over time.

Identification Criteria

Price consistently seeks opposing liquidity pools.

Expansion phases follow inducement of uninformed participation.

Time-of-day governs volatility and delivery likelihood.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Price is anticipated to seek opposing liquidity rather than follow retail technical patterns.

Algorithms operate at specific times of day to deliver price efficiently.

Fair Value Gaps are manifestations of inefficient price delivery that price later seeks to rebalance.
