Economic Calendar as Volatility Catalyst (News Embargo Framework)
Canonical Definition

The Economic Calendar acts as a scheduled volatility catalyst, where price often compresses or repositions ahead of high-impact events and expands directionally once the news embargo lifts.

Identification Criteria

Scheduled economic releases listed on a public economic calendar.

Events classified by impact level (low, medium, high).

Specific release times aligned to New York local time.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Traders must consult an economic calendar prior to trading to avoid unexpected volatility.

High-impact news can be used as a smokescreen or catalyst for directional price delivery.
(Source: Episode 10)

Price often builds up or drops immediately before a scheduled report, with the real move occurring after release.

Not all scheduled events are heavy hitters, but most materially affect stock indices.

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Volatility expansion following news is often aligned with pre-existing daily bias.
(Source: Episode 10 — CLEAR INFERENCE)

News releases are frequently used to justify liquidity runs rather than to change bias.
