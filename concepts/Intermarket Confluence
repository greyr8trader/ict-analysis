Intermarket Confluence (Index Correlation Framework)
Canonical Definition

Intermarket Confluence describes the use of correlated markets (e.g., NASDAQ, S&P, Dow) to confirm or invalidate anticipated price delivery through relative strength, weakness, or non-confirmation at key liquidity levels.

Identification Criteria

One index takes liquidity while another does not.

Correlated markets diverge near prior highs or lows.

Relative unwillingness of one market to deliver to a liquidity level.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Correlated indices generally move in tandem, but temporary divergence can signal accumulation or distribution.

A market’s unwillingness to make a lower low while correlated markets do so can confirm a bullish shift.
