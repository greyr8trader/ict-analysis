Intermarket Confluence (Index Correlation Framework)
Canonical Definition

Intermarket Confluence describes the use of correlated markets (e.g., NASDAQ, S&P, Dow) to confirm or invalidate anticipated price delivery through relative strength, weakness, or non-confirmation at key liquidity levels.
Intermarket Confluence describes how correlated or inversely correlated markets (e.g., Dollar Index vs FX pairs or equity indices) provide confirmation or invalidation of directional bias.

Identification Criteria

One index takes liquidity while another does not.

Correlated markets diverge near prior highs or lows.

Relative unwillingness of one market to deliver to a liquidity level.

In currency pairs, directional bias is derived from relative strength and weakness of the component currencies.

A currency pair is expected to rise when the base currency is strong and the quote currency is weak.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Correlated indices generally move in tandem, but temporary divergence can signal accumulation or distribution.
(Source: Episode 7)

A market’s unwillingness to make a lower low while correlated markets do so can confirm a bullish shift.
(Source: Episode 7)

Intermarket confirmation is used after liquidity events, not in isolation.
(Source: Episode 7)

Intermarket confluence applies to Forex by decomposing the pair into its two component instruments.
(Source: Episode 8)

Confirmation can be obtained by observing Euro futures for Euro pairs and corresponding Yen behavior for Yen crosses.
(Source: Episode 8)

Confirmation can be obtained by observing correlated indices delivering in the same direction.
(Source: Episode 14)

In Forex, intermarket confirmation is achieved by decomposing a pair into base and quote currencies and assessing relative strength/weakness.
(Source: Episode 17)

Forex pairs must be evaluated against a barometer market (e.g., Dollar Index) to confirm or invalidate apparent breakouts.
(Source: Episode 20)

Inverted relationships (e.g., USD ↔ EUR) allow one market’s liquidity objective to confirm another market’s reversal.
(Source: Episode 20)

Rising Dollar Index reflects risk-off conditions, generally pressuring risk assets lower.
(Source: Episode 21)

Declining Dollar Index reflects risk-on conditions, generally supporting risk assets.
(Source: Episode 21)

Forex pairs should be evaluated relative to Dollar Index direction for sustained moves.
(Source: Episode 21)

Equity indices often move inversely to the Dollar Index during risk-off phases.

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Intermarket divergence provides confirmation of an already-established narrative.
(Source: Episode 7 — CLEAR INFERENCE)

Validity Conditions

Requires at least two correlated markets.

Requires alignment with time-of-day and liquidity context.

Intermarket analysis is most effective when both markets reach opposing liquidity objectives simultaneously.
(Source: Episode 20)

Intermarket signals are strongest when both markets reach or react from liquidity objectives concurrently.
(Source: Episode 21)

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

What This Concept Is NOT

Not indicator-based divergence.

Not a standalone entry signal.

Not predictive by itself.

Not exotic-pair prediction without component confirmation.
(Source: Episode 8)

Ambiguities / Conflicts

Degree and duration of divergence are not quantitatively defined.
