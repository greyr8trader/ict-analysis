Fair Value Gap (Imbalance)
Canonical Definition

A Fair Value Gap is a price imbalance created when a single candle moves without overlap between the previous candle’s high and the next candle’s low.

A single impulsive candle creating inefficiency qualifies as an imbalance.

Rebalancing that inefficiency creates an intermediate-term swing point.
(Source: Episode 12)

Identification Criteria

One-directional candle.

No overlap between adjacent candles.

Forms immediately after a market structure break.

Clarified that a Fair Value Gap is defined using a three-candle sequence, where:

The middle candle delivers displacement

The gap exists between the prior candle’s high and the subsequent candle’s low
(Source: Episode 6)

Fair Value Gaps may be identified on lower timeframes (5m–1m) within a higher-timeframe price leg.
(Source: Episode 8)

An imbalance may coexist with a price gap, reinforcing inefficiency.
(Source: Episode 22)

Imbalance relevance is evaluated by body interaction, not wick extremes, during volatility.
(Source: Episode 23)

The Fair Value Gap is measured from the displacement leg, not from arbitrary candles.
(Source: Episode 24)

FVG relevance is assessed relative to the most recent liquidity event (sell-side or buy-side taken).
(Source: Episode 26)

“Close proximity” interaction with an imbalance is acceptable when price does not fully rebalance the gap.
(Source: Episode 29)

Imbalance relevance is assessed in context of the most recent liquidity event (e.g., lunch-hour sweep).
(Source: Episode 30)

FVG relevance is confirmed when followed by:

a swing formation, and

continuation toward the higher-timeframe liquidity objective.
(Source: Episode 31)

Imbalances may appear only on lower timeframes (e.g., 5-minute) and still govern delivery.
(Source: Episode 33)

An imbalance’s relevance is confirmed when price:

trades away impulsively, then

returns to the imbalance before expanding again.
(Source: Episode 34)

Imbalance relevance increases when it aligns with:

prior liquidity clearance, and

premium/discount context.
(Source: Episode 36)

Fair Value Gaps identified on the daily timeframe remain relevant when transposed to lower timeframes.
(Source: Episode 37)

A Fair Value Gap is contextualized by:

premium/discount relative to the active dealing range, and

proximity to liquidity pools.
(Source: Episode 38)

Fair Value Gaps are most actionable when aligned with:

session timing, and

liquidity objectives beyond the gap.
(Source: Episode 39)

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Fair Value Gaps are used as entry delivery zones after a break in market structure.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Price often retraces into the imbalance before continuing.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

A Fair Value Gap must exist between the candle high preceding displacement and the candle low following it.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

If no Fair Value Gap forms after a swing violation, no trade setup exists.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Fair Value Gaps are evaluated only after displacement, not before.
(Source: Episode 5)

If price retraces into an FVG created by displacement, it qualifies as a valid delivery zone.
(Source: Episode 5)

A Fair Value Gap must result from energetic displacement, not gradual price movement.
(Source: Episode 6)

Lower-timeframe FVGs are valid only when aligned with higher-timeframe bias and session timing.
(Source: Episode 8)

Fair Value Gaps created during manipulation phases often serve as support during distribution.
(Source: Episode 9)

Fair Value Gaps act as precision entry zones when aligned with:

Prior swing highs

Market structure

Liquidity draw
(Source: Episode 11)

Entry into an FVG does not require price to reach the extreme of the range.
(Source: Episode 11)

Price often returns to rebalance an imbalance before continuing toward liquidity.
(Source: Episode 12)

Imbalances exist across all timeframes and form fractal relationships.
(Source: Episode 12)

(Source: Episode 13)

(Source: Episode 14)

An imbalance is considered complete only after the displacement candle closes.
(Source: Episode 15)

Price may overshoot the low boundary of an imbalance intraday without invalidating it, when evaluated within a higher-timeframe bullish narrative.
(Source: Episode 15)

Higher-timeframe Fair Value Gaps provide context, even when lower-timeframe imbalances appear noisy.
(Source: Episode 16)

Lower-timeframe FVGs must be interpreted within the higher-timeframe narrative.
(Source: Episode 16)

(Source: Episode 17)

Higher-timeframe imbalances act as parent PD arrays to lower-timeframe imbalances.
(Source: Episode 18)

Lower-timeframe Fair Value Gaps are only actionable when aligned with the higher-timeframe imbalance narrative.
(Source: Episode 18)

Session context governs relevance.

(Source: Episode 19)

A Fair Value Gap is not actionable until price has clearly displaced away from it.
(Source: Episode 20)

Immediate re-entry into an imbalance without displacement does not qualify as valid delivery.
(Source: Episode 20)

(Source: Episode 22)

Wicks probing beyond an imbalance boundary are permissible price action.
(Source: Episode 22)

During high-volatility events (e.g., FOMC), price may dip slightly beyond an imbalance boundary without invalidating it, provided candle bodies respect the imbalance.

(Source: Episode 23)

Fair Value Gaps are only considered after a valid Market Structure Shift.
(Source: Episode 24)

An imbalance defines the area where a setup may form, not a guaranteed trade.

(Source: Episode 25)

FVGs are evaluated only after displacement and within the correct time window.
(Source: Episode 25)

Re-entry back into a Fair Value Gap after a liquidity run supports continuation toward opposing liquidity, not immediate reversal.
(Source: Episode 26)

Interaction with an FVG can be brief and partial; full rebalancing is not required.
(Source: Episode 26)

Fair Value Gaps can be used in counter-trend contexts when aligned with:

Liquidity draw, and

Discount / Premium location.
