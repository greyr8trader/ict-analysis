Fair Value Gap (Imbalance)
Canonical Definition

A Fair Value Gap is a price imbalance created when a single candle moves without overlap between the previous candle’s high and the next candle’s low.

A single impulsive candle creating inefficiency qualifies as an imbalance.

Rebalancing that inefficiency creates an intermediate-term swing point.
(Source: Episode 12)

Identification Criteria

One-directional candle.

No overlap between adjacent candles.

Forms immediately after a market structure break.

Clarified that a Fair Value Gap is defined using a three-candle sequence, where:

The middle candle delivers displacement

The gap exists between the prior candle’s high and the subsequent candle’s low
(Source: Episode 6)

Fair Value Gaps may be identified on lower timeframes (5m–1m) within a higher-timeframe price leg.
(Source: Episode 8)

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Fair Value Gaps are used as entry delivery zones after a break in market structure.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Price often retraces into the imbalance before continuing.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

A Fair Value Gap must exist between the candle high preceding displacement and the candle low following it.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

If no Fair Value Gap forms after a swing violation, no trade setup exists.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Fair Value Gaps are evaluated only after displacement, not before.
(Source: Episode 5)

If price retraces into an FVG created by displacement, it qualifies as a valid delivery zone.
(Source: Episode 5)

A Fair Value Gap must result from energetic displacement, not gradual price movement.
(Source: Episode 6)

Lower-timeframe FVGs are valid only when aligned with higher-timeframe bias and session timing.
(Source: Episode 8)

Fair Value Gaps created during manipulation phases often serve as support during distribution.
(Source: Episode 9)

Fair Value Gaps act as precision entry zones when aligned with:

Prior swing highs

Market structure

Liquidity draw
(Source: Episode 11)

Entry into an FVG does not require price to reach the extreme of the range.
(Source: Episode 11)

Price often returns to rebalance an imbalance before continuing toward liquidity.
(Source: Episode 12)

Imbalances exist across all timeframes and form fractal relationships.
(Source: Episode 12)

Price does not always fully rebalance a Fair Value Gap before continuing toward its liquidity objective.
(Source: Episode 13)

Shallow retracements into an FVG can be sufficient for continuation.
(Source: Episode 13)

A Fair Value Gap can be used as a limit-entry reference after a confirmed market structure shift.
(Source: Episode 14)

Closure or partial closure of a Fair Value Gap often precedes directional continuation.
(Source: Episode 14)

An imbalance is considered complete only after the displacement candle closes.
(Source: Episode 15)

Price may overshoot the low boundary of an imbalance intraday without invalidating it, when evaluated within a higher-timeframe bullish narrative.
(Source: Episode 15)

Higher-timeframe Fair Value Gaps provide context, even when lower-timeframe imbalances appear noisy.
(Source: Episode 16)

Lower-timeframe FVGs must be interpreted within the higher-timeframe narrative.
(Source: Episode 16)

Partial fills of an imbalance may be sufficient prior to continuation toward liquidity in FX.
(Source: Episode 17)

Higher-timeframe imbalances act as parent PD arrays to lower-timeframe imbalances.
(Source: Episode 18)

Lower-timeframe Fair Value Gaps are only actionable when aligned with the higher-timeframe imbalance narrative.
(Source: Episode 18)

Lower-timeframe FVGs must align with session manipulation phase to be actionable.

Session context governs relevance.

(Source: Episode 19)

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Fair Value Gaps are algorithmically rebalanced for efficient price delivery.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Strong displacement candles formed immediately after news releases frequently create Fair Value Gaps.
(Source: Episode 10 — CLEAR INFERENCE)

Narrative context governs tolerance for minor intraday violations around imbalance boundaries.
(Source: Episode 15 — CLEAR INFERENCE)

Validity Conditions

Occurs most frequently on lower timeframes (1m–3m) in indices.

Fair Value Gaps are evaluated relative to the current defined range and its equilibrium.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

What This Concept Is NOT

Not supply/demand zones.

Not gaps caused by illiquidity between sessions.

Not every gap or inefficiency qualifies as an FVG without displacement.
(Source: Episode 5)

Wick-only inefficiencies or slow grind price action do not qualify as Fair Value Gaps.
(Source: Episode 6)

Not all imbalances are tradeable; context determines relevance.
(Source: Episode 18)

Ambiguities / Conflicts

No explicit rule for minimum size or candle count.
