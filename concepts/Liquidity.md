Liquidity (Buy-Side / Sell-Side)
Canonical Definition

Liquidity refers to resting stop orders above prior highs (buy-side liquidity) and below prior lows (sell-side liquidity) that price is algorithmically drawn toward.

Identification Criteria

Prior swing highs indicate locations of buy stops.

Prior swing lows indicate locations of sell stops.

Consolidation followed by expansion increases probability of a liquidity draw.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Markets draw to one of two things: liquidity (stops) or imbalance.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Buy stops rest above old highs; sell stops rest below old lows.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Liquidity is engineered before large directional moves.

Sell-side liquidity below prior daily lows remains a valid draw even after extended consolidation.

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)
