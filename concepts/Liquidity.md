Liquidity (Buy-Side / Sell-Side)
Canonical Definition

Liquidity refers to resting stop orders above prior highs (buy-side liquidity) and below prior lows (sell-side liquidity) that price is algorithmically drawn toward.

Identification Criteria

Prior swing highs indicate locations of buy stops.

Prior swing lows indicate locations of sell stops.

Consolidation followed by expansion increases probability of a liquidity draw.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Markets draw to one of two things: liquidity (stops) or imbalance.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Buy stops rest above old highs; sell stops rest below old lows.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Liquidity is engineered before large directional moves.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Sell-side liquidity below prior daily lows remains a valid draw even after extended consolidation.
(Source: Episode 11)

Buy-side liquidity above relative equal highs serves as a primary draw during bullish expansions.
(Source: Episode 13)

Buy-side liquidity above prior relative highs remains a valid draw even after short-term consolidation.
(Source: Episode 14)

Sell-side liquidity commonly rests below the most recent short-term swing low immediately following a bullish structure shift.
(Source: Episode 15)

Liquidity may be taken before price delivers into an imbalance.

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Liquidity runs often precede reversals when aligned with higher-timeframe bias.

Validity Conditions

Most relevant when price is consolidating or approaching prior highs/lows.

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

Ambiguities / Conflicts

Speaker rejects auction theory equivalence without formal definition.
