Order Block (Change in State of Delivery)
Canonical Definition

An Order Block is the price level marking a change in the state of delivery, identified by the opening price of a sequence of candles whose direction is later violated.
An order block is a series of consecutive up-closed or down-closed candles formed within valid market structure, representing institutional order flow.

Identification Criteria

Consecutive candles closing in one direction.

The opening price of the first candle in that sequence.

Subsequent violation of that opening price.

Consecutive down-closed candles preceding impulsive expansion define a bullish order block.

Order blocks are not limited to the last candle before displacement.

Multiple consecutive candles may define the valid order block range.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

An order block is defined by a change in the state of delivery when its originating open is violated.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

Multiple consecutive candles can form a single order block.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

Order blocks formed during manipulation can act as entry anchors during distribution.
(Source: Episode 9)

In bearish conditions:

Up-closed candles act as resistance.

Price should not trade above them if the bearish premise is valid.
(Source: Episode 12)

In bullish conditions:

Down-closed candles act as support.
(Source: Episode 12)

In bullish conditions, down-closed candles act as support and may be revisited multiple times without being violated.
(Source: Episode 13)

Order blocks must be evaluated within the prevailing structural narrative, not in isolation.
(Source: Episode 13)

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Order blocks gain significance when aligned with liquidity runs and structure shifts.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

Validity Conditions

Must coincide with a structural change and liquidity event.

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

What This Concept Is NOT

Not every down-closed or up-closed candle.

Not supply and demand zones.

Not simply “the last up candle before a drop.”

Not a single-candle concept divorced from structure.
