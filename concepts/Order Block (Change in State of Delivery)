Order Block (Change in State of Delivery)
Canonical Definition

An Order Block is the price level marking a change in the state of delivery, identified by the opening price of a sequence of candles whose direction is later violated.
An order block is a series of consecutive up-closed or down-closed candles formed within valid market structure, representing institutional order flow.
An Order Block is a series of consecutive candles representing a change in delivery that must be validated by an associated imbalance.

Identification Criteria

Consecutive candles closing in one direction.

The opening price of the first candle in that sequence.

Subsequent violation of that opening price.

Consecutive down-closed candles preceding impulsive expansion define a bullish order block.
(Source: Episode 9)

Order blocks are not limited to the last candle before displacement.

Multiple consecutive candles may define the valid order block range.
(Source: Episode 12)

An Order Block is invalid without an accompanying Fair Value Gap.
(Source: Episode 18)

The Order Block may consist of multiple consecutive candles, not necessarily the last up-close or down-close candle.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

An order block is defined by a change in the state of delivery when its originating open is violated.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

Multiple consecutive candles can form a single order block.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

Order blocks formed during manipulation can act as entry anchors during distribution.
(Source: Episode 9)

In bearish conditions:

Up-closed candles act as resistance.

Price should not trade above them if the bearish premise is valid.
(Source: Episode 12)

In bullish conditions:

Down-closed candles act as support.
(Source: Episode 12)

In bullish conditions, down-closed candles act as support and may be revisited multiple times without being violated.
(Source: Episode 13)

Order blocks must be evaluated within the prevailing structural narrative, not in isolation.
(Source: Episode 13)

The market is not required to trade into the final candle of an Order Block.
(Source: Episode 18)

Parent-timeframe imbalances can cap price delivery, preventing deeper Order Block interaction.
(Source: Episode 18)

Candle bodies prioritized over wicks for Order Block relevance.

OB requires displacement + FVG to validate.

OB is a reference bookmark, not a supply/demand zone.

(Source: Episode 19)

Daily Order Blocks provide directional bias, even when not part of the intraday entry model.
(Source: Episode 21)

Price is less likely to trade to the high of a bearish daily Order Block.
(Source: Episode 21)

Order Blocks must be evaluated by candle bodies, not wick extremes.
(Source: Episode 22)

Price may wick beyond an Order Block without invalidating it, provided the candle bodies respect the zone.
(Source: Episode 22)

An Order Block gains validity when aligned with:

Higher-timeframe narrative

Liquidity draw

Associated imbalance
(Source: Episode 22)

Order Block validity is determined by candle bodies respecting the zone, even if wicks probe beyond during volatility.
(Source: Episode 23)

A bearish Order Block may be revisited and respected before continuation in the direction of the prevailing narrative.
(Source: Episode 23)

A bullish Order Block may be defined by two consecutive down-closed candles, with the upper candle’s open/body acting as the primary reference.
(Source: Episode 26)

Price may touch only the wick of the referenced Order Block candle and still respect it.
(Source: Episode 26)

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Order blocks gain significance when aligned with liquidity runs and structure shifts.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

Order blocks may align with Fair Value Gap retracements during continuation phases.
(Source: Episode 14 — CLEAR INFERENCE)

Validity Conditions

Must coincide with a structural change and liquidity event.

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

What This Concept Is NOT

Not every down-closed or up-closed candle.

Not supply and demand zones.

Not simply “the last up candle before a drop.”

Not a single-candle concept divorced from structure.
(Source: Episode 12)

Not supply & demand zones.

Not “last candle before a move” logic.
(Source: Episode 18)

Not a guaranteed reversal zone.
(Source: Episode 21)

Not a single “entry candle”.

Not invalidated by minor wick penetration.
(Source: Episode 22)

Not invalidated by minor wick penetration during news-driven volatility.
(Source: Episode 23)

Not required to trade into the deepest portion of the Order Block to be valid.
(Source: Episode 26)

Ambiguities / Conflicts

No explicit minimum candle count defined.
