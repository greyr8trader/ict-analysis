Top-Down Timeframe Bias
Canonical Definition

Directional bias is established on higher timeframes and refined on lower timeframes for execution.

Identification Criteria

Weekly chart defines expected expansion.

Daily chart identifies liquidity pools.

Intraday charts provide execution logic.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Weekly candle establishes primary bias.

(Source: Episode 10)

Daily chart bias governs all lower-timeframe trade ideas.
(Source: Episode 12)

Trading against the daily narrative increases failure probability.
(Source: Episode 12 — explicit warning)

Lower-timeframe setups are filtered by higher-timeframe bias.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Intraday price action should be interpreted through the lens of daily expansion narrative.
(Source: Episode 6 — CLEAR INFERENCE)
