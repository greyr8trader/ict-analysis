Power of Three (Accumulation–Manipulation–Distribution)
Canonical Definition

Power of Three describes a recurring price delivery sequence in which price first consolidates (accumulation), then performs a false move (manipulation), and finally delivers the intended directional expansion (distribution), often within a single session or trading day.

Identification Criteria

A defined opening price or opening range.

Initial consolidation or compression.

A false move away from the eventual directional objective.

Subsequent expansion in the true directional bias.

In FX, manipulation (Judas Swing) often occurs above/below the session opening price (midnight NY and/or 08:30 recalibration).

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Power of Three consists of accumulation, manipulation, and distribution phases.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 9)

In a bullish Power of Three:

Price opens near the low,

Trades lower (manipulation),

Then rallies and closes higher (distribution).
(Source: Episode 9)

The manipulation phase often appears as a Judas Swing.
(Source: Episode 9)

The opening price (e.g., 08:30 NY) can be used as a key reference for identifying the sequence.
(Source: Episode 9)

News releases frequently coincide with the manipulation → distribution transition within Power of Three.
(Source: Episode 10)

Manipulation phases may include false rallies or sell-offs designed to draw participation before distribution.
(Source: Episode 11)

Manipulation phases often coincide with:

Equity market open, or

Short-term false moves against the prevailing bias.
(Source: Episode 13)

Manipulation frequently manifests as a Judas Swing relative to the session opening price.
(Source: Episode 16)

Distribution may occur later in the same session or extend into the PM session.
(Source: Episode 16)

Judas Swing explicitly defined as price moving below NY Midnight Open or 08:30 Open opposite daily bias.

Midnight and 08:30 openings are accumulation anchors for Po3.

(Source: Episode 19)

Accumulation often forms below opening prices in strongly bearish markets.
(Source: Episode 21)

Manipulation may be minimal or absent in extreme directional conditions.
(Source: Episode 21)

Power of Three frequently manifests as:

Rally above session open (manipulation), followed by

Distribution below relative equal lows.
(Source: Episode 22)

Distribution often coincides with sell-side liquidity below well-known lows.
(Source: Episode 22)

In bearish conditions:

Accumulation occurs below session open,

Manipulation rallies price into premium,

Distribution expands toward sell-side liquidity.
(Source: Episode 25)

Counter-trend participation typically aligns with the distribution phase of Power of Three within the session.
(Source: Episode 27)

Manipulation frequently occurs at session open, even when the broader trend is bearish.
(Source: Episode 27)

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Manipulation targets short-term liquidity pools formed during accumulation.
(Source: Episode 9 — CLEAR INFERENCE)

Distribution aligns with the prevailing higher-timeframe bias.

Not candle-pattern prediction.

Not guaranteed daily direction.

Not dependent on predicting the closing price.
