Power of Three (Accumulation–Manipulation–Distribution)
Canonical Definition

Power of Three describes a recurring price delivery sequence in which price first consolidates (accumulation), then performs a false move (manipulation), and finally delivers the intended directional expansion (distribution), often within a single session or trading day.

Identification Criteria

A defined opening price or opening range.

Initial consolidation or compression.

A false move away from the eventual directional objective.

Subsequent expansion in the true directional bias.
