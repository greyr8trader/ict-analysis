Premium / Discount (50% Equilibrium)
Canonical Definition

Premium and Discount are relative price states defined by the midpoint (50%) of a defined range.

Identification Criteria

Define a range (e.g., high of day to low of day).

Calculate 50% midpoint.

Above = premium, below = discount.

Equilibrium can be defined using the most recent impulsive price leg, even when a larger range is not obvious.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Shorts are preferred when price is in premium; longs when in discount.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Algorithms seek opposing side of the range for delivery.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

The equilibrium level is derived from the most recent significant low-to-high range, not necessarily a session range.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Targets should exist below equilibrium for shorts and above equilibrium for longs.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Counter-trend longs are only considered when price trades at or below equilibrium (discount).
(Source: Episode 27)

Counter-trend shorts are only considered when price trades at or above equilibrium (premium).
(Source: Episode 27)

The middle of the daily dealing range acts as a natural gravitational target after liquidity is run above or below the range.
(Source: Episode 32)

Premium and discount are assessed relative to the most recent dealing range, not fixed session extremes.
(Source: Episode 33)

Failure to reach a visible premium does not invalidate the model if the liquidity objective remains active.
(Source: Episode 33)

Premium and discount must be measured using the impulsive price leg in the intended direction, not arbitrary highs/lows.
(Source: Episode 34)

The 50% equilibrium of the active dealing range acts as a key filter for retracement-based participation.
(Source: Episode 34)

The 50% equilibrium must be measured using the active dealing range associated with the most recent impulsive leg.
(Source: Episode 35)

Equilibrium drawn from older or counter-trend legs is invalid for current decision-making.
(Source: Episode 35)

Premium and discount are defined strictly relative to the active swing high–low range, not by indicators.
(Source: Episode 36)

Price trading below the 50% equilibrium places the market in discount, regardless of perceived “oversold” conditions.
(Source: Episode 36)

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Premium/discount assists in target selection after entry.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Premium/discount is used to filter valid targets, not to trigger entries.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Validity Conditions

Requires a clearly defined range.

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

What This Concept Is NOT

Not Fibonacci trading strategy.

Not valuation analysis.

Not justification for trading mid-range.
(Source: Episode 27)

Mid-range is not a random target; it is a mean-reversion objective on consolidation days.
(Source: Episode 32)

Equilibrium is not measured from counter-trend swings.

Not every 50% level is relevant without context.
(Source: Episode 34)

Equilibrium is not static across sessions.

Not every 50% level is actionable.
(Source: Episode 35)

Discount does not require oscillators or indicators.

Equilibrium is not subjective.
(Source: Episode 36)

Ambiguities / Conflicts

Range selection hierarchy not formally defined.
