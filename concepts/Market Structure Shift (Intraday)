Market Structure Shift (Intraday)
Canonical Definition

A Market Structure Shift is an intraday change in directional delivery that occurs after liquidity has been taken, indicated by violation of a previously formed short-term swing high or swing low.
Market structure is defined by hierarchical swing relationships (short-term, intermediate-term, long-term), where higher-timeframe swings subordinate lower-timeframe price action.

Identification Criteria

A swing high or swing low is formed.

Buy-side or sell-side liquidity is taken.

Price subsequently trades through the short-term swing level on lower timeframes (1m–3m).

A swing high is defined as a candle with lower highs on both the left and right.
(Source: Episode 11)

Swing highs and lows can be classified as:

Short-term

Intermediate-term

Long-term
based on their relative nesting.
(Source: Episode 11)

Swings are classified as:

Short-term

Intermediate-term

Long-term

An intermediate-term high or low forms when an imbalance is rebalanced.

Intermediate-term highs/lows should not be violated if the prevailing directional narrative remains valid.

An intermediate-term low forms when:

A retracement into an imbalance occurs, and

Price subsequently resumes higher without violating that low.
(Source: Episode 13)

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

A short-term low or high being violated after a liquidity run constitutes a market structure shift.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Market structure shifts are used only after liquidity has been taken.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Intraday market structure shifts are distinct from higher-timeframe market structure breaks.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

A market structure shift is confirmed at the moment price trades through the swing, not at candle close.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

A structure shift is invalid if price violates a prior high or low but fails to produce a Fair Value Gap.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Swing highs and swing lows used for structure are defined as three-candle formations, independent of candle close direction.
(Source: Episode 5)

A valid intraday structure event requires energetic displacement, not a slow or anemic move.
(Source: Episode 5)

A valid intraday structure shift requires impulsive displacement, not a slow or overlapping move.
(Source: Episode 6)

Wick-only violations of a swing high/low do not constitute a valid structure shift.
(Source: Episode 6)

Structure shifts occurring during heavy consolidation require additional confirmation.
(Source: Episode 7)

A valid intraday structure shift may occur across multiple lower timeframes (15m → 5m → 3m → 1m) within the same price leg.
(Source: Episode 8)

A structure shift is confirmed when both a prior low and a prior high are violated within the same leg, followed by displacement.
(Source: Episode 8)

Manipulation phases often include a short-term structure violation that precedes true directional delivery.
(Source: Episode 9)

Structure analysis requires hierarchical comparison of swings, not simple lower-high / lower-low logic.
(Source: Episode 11)

Wick violations without displacement are insufficient for confirming structure change.
(Source: Episode 11)

A simple higher-high / higher-low model is insufficient for determining structure.
(Source: Episode 12)

Intermediate-term highs must have:

A lower short-term high to the left

A lower short-term high to the right
(OR form via imbalance rebalance)
(Source: Episode 12)

If an intermediate-term high is violated after being formed, the prior directional idea is invalidated.
(Source: Episode 12)

Once an intermediate-term low is formed, it should not be violated before the intended liquidity objective is reached.
(Source: Episode 13)

A market structure shift establishes directional bias before seeking Fair Value Gap retracement.
(Source: Episode 14)

A bullish intraday market structure shift is confirmed when a prior short-term swing high is traded through following displacement.
(Source: Episode 15)

Structure confirmation precedes any expectation of retracement into imbalance.
(Source: Episode 15)

Market structure shifts may occur multiple times intraday without negating the higher-timeframe bias.
(Source: Episode 16)

An intermediate-term high is confirmed when price retraces into an imbalance and fails to exceed it within a bearish narrative.
(Source: Episode 17)

An internal Market Structure Shift occurs when:

A short-term swing is violated, and

Delivery changes direction with displacement.
(Source: Episode 18)

MSS is validated after session manipulation and confirmed by displacement away from the opening price.

(Source: Episode 19)

A market structure shift is confirmed after displacement away from a Fair Value Gap, not merely after a swing violation.
(Source: Episode 20)

Intraday structure shifts align with displacement away from session opening prices.
(Source: Episode 21)

Market Structure must be interpreted hierarchically:

Short-term

Intermediate-term

Long-term
(Source: Episode 22)

An intermediate-term high or low is often confirmed through displacement and imbalance formation.
(Source: Episode 22)

Intraday structure confirmation may occur after volatility subsides, not necessarily on the first impulse move.
(Source: Episode 23)

A valid Market Structure Shift requires:

A run on liquidity, and

Displacement that takes out a short-term swing low (bearish case) or high (bullish case).
(Source: Episode 24)

A simple move above or below a level does NOT qualify as a structure shift.
(Source: Episode 24)

Market Structure Shift is confirmed by:

Liquidity run →

Displacement →

Subsequent imbalance
(Source: Episode 25)

Intraday structure confirmation is reinforced when:

Sell-side liquidity is taken,

Price re-enters an imbalance, and

Delivery shifts toward opposing liquidity.
(Source: Episode 26)

Counter-trend entries require an intraday structure shift, even when the higher-timeframe bias remains opposite.
(Source: Episode 27)

A bullish intraday Market Structure Shift is confirmed when:

Sell-side liquidity is taken, and

Subsequent price action fails to make a lower low, then

Short-term highs are displaced to the upside.
(Source: Episode 29)

A valid setup does not need to appear during the initial sell-off; the structure shift may only become clear after manipulation completes.
(Source: Episode 30)

A swing high followed by bearish displacement supports continuation toward external sell-side liquidity.
(Source: Episode 31)

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Intraday market structure shifts typically lead to single intraday price legs, not multi-day trends.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

A structure shift requires both swing violation and displacement to be actionable.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Directional intent following a shift aligns with the most recent liquidity event.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Structure shifts formed without displacement are invalid.
(Source: Episode 6)

MSS signals are weaker when price oscillates around equilibrium.
(Source: Episode 7 — CLEAR INFERENCE)

Validity Conditions

Must occur after a confirmed buy-side or sell-side liquidity run.

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

Violation of an intermediate-term high (bearish case) or low (bullish case) invalidates the structural premise.
(Source: Episode 12)

If displacement does not occur after a liquidity run, no setup exists.
(Source: Episode 24)

Without displacement, no structure shift exists, regardless of swing violations.
(Source: Episode 25)

What This Concept Is NOT

Not trendline breaks.

Not indicator-based confirmation.

Not higher-timeframe structural reversal.

Not every intraday sell-off constitutes a setup.
(Source: Episode 30)


Ambiguities / Conflicts

Exact candle-count definition for swings is not formally quantified.
