Market Structure Shift (Intraday)
Canonical Definition

A Market Structure Shift is an intraday change in directional delivery that occurs after liquidity has been taken, indicated by violation of a short-term swing.

Identification Criteria

Liquidity is first taken (buy-side or sell-side).

A short-term swing high or low is then violated on lower timeframes (1m–3m).

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Intraday market structure shifts are distinct from higher-timeframe market structure breaks.
