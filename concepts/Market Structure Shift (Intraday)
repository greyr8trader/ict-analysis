Market Structure Shift (Intraday)
Canonical Definition

A Market Structure Shift is an intraday change in directional delivery that occurs after liquidity has been taken, indicated by violation of a short-term swing.

Identification Criteria

Liquidity is first taken (buy-side or sell-side).

A short-term swing high or low is then violated on lower timeframes (1m–3m).

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Intraday market structure shifts are distinct from higher-timeframe market structure breaks.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

A structure shift is only meaningful after liquidity has been taken.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

A market structure shift is confirmed at the moment price trades through a short-term swing, not after candle close.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

A structure shift is invalid if price violates a prior high but fails to produce a Fair Value Gap.

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Intraday structure shifts often lead to a single price leg rather than multi-day movement.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

Market structure shifts require both swing violation and displacement to be actionable.

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.
