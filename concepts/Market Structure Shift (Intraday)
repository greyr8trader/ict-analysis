Market Structure Shift (Intraday)
Canonical Definition

A Market Structure Shift is an intraday change in directional delivery that occurs after liquidity has been taken, indicated by violation of a previously formed short-term swing high or swing low.

Identification Criteria

A swing high or swing low is formed.

Buy-side or sell-side liquidity is taken.

Price subsequently trades through the short-term swing level on lower timeframes (1m–3m).

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

A short-term low or high being violated after a liquidity run constitutes a market structure shift.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Market structure shifts are used only after liquidity has been taken.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Intraday market structure shifts are distinct from higher-timeframe market structure breaks.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

A market structure shift is confirmed at the moment price trades through the swing, not at candle close.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

A structure shift is invalid if price violates a prior high or low but fails to produce a Fair Value Gap.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Swing highs and swing lows used for structure are defined as three-candle formations, independent of candle close direction.
(Source: Episode 5)

A valid intraday structure event requires energetic displacement, not a slow or anemic move.

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Intraday market structure shifts typically lead to single intraday price legs, not multi-day trends.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

A structure shift requires both swing violation and displacement to be actionable.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Directional intent following a shift aligns with the most recent liquidity event.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Validity Conditions

Must occur after a confirmed buy-side or sell-side liquidity run.

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

What This Concept Is NOT

Not trendline breaks.

Not indicator-based confirmation.

Not higher-timeframe structural reversal.

Ambiguities / Conflicts

Exact candle-count definition for swings is not formally quantified.
