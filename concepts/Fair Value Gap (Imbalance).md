Fair Value Gap (Imbalance)
Canonical Definition

A Fair Value Gap is a price imbalance created when a single candle moves without overlap between the previous candle’s high and the next candle’s low.

Identification Criteria

One-directional candle.

No overlap between adjacent candles.

Forms immediately after a market structure break.

Clarified that a Fair Value Gap is defined using a three-candle sequence, where:

The middle candle delivers displacement

The gap exists between the prior candle’s high and the subsequent candle’s low
(Source: Episode 6)

Fair Value Gaps may be identified on lower timeframes (5m–1m) within a higher-timeframe price leg.
(Source: Episode 8)

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Fair Value Gaps are used as entry delivery zones after a break in market structure.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Price often retraces into the imbalance before continuing.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

A Fair Value Gap must exist between the candle high preceding displacement and the candle low following it.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

If no Fair Value Gap forms after a swing violation, no trade setup exists.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Fair Value Gaps are evaluated only after displacement, not before.
(Source: Episode 5)

If price retraces into an FVG created by displacement, it qualifies as a valid delivery zone.
(Source: Episode 5)

A Fair Value Gap must result from energetic displacement, not gradual price movement.
(Source: Episode 6)

Lower-timeframe FVGs are valid only when aligned with higher-timeframe bias and session timing.
(Source: Episode 8)

Fair Value Gaps created during manipulation phases often serve as support during distribution.
(Source: Episode 9)

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Fair Value Gaps are algorithmically rebalanced for efficient price delivery.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Strong displacement candles formed immediately after news releases frequently create Fair Value Gaps.
(Source: Episode 10 — CLEAR INFERENCE)

Validity Conditions

Occurs most frequently on lower timeframes (1m–3m) in indices.

Fair Value Gaps are evaluated relative to the current defined range and its equilibrium.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

What This Concept Is NOT

Not supply/demand zones.

Not gaps caused by illiquidity between sessions.

Not every gap or inefficiency qualifies as an FVG without displacement.
(Source: Episode 5)

Wick-only inefficiencies or slow grind price action do not qualify as Fair Value Gaps.
(Source: Episode 6)

Ambiguities / Conflicts

No explicit rule for minimum size or candle count.
