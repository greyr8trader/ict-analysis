Liquidity (Buy-Side / Sell-Side)
Canonical Definition

Liquidity refers to resting stop orders above prior highs (buy-side liquidity) and below prior lows (sell-side liquidity) that price is algorithmically drawn toward.

Identification Criteria

Prior swing highs indicate locations of buy stops.

Prior swing lows indicate locations of sell stops.

Consolidation followed by expansion increases probability of a liquidity draw.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Markets draw to one of two things: liquidity (stops) or imbalance.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Buy stops rest above old highs; sell stops rest below old lows.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Liquidity is engineered before large directional moves.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Sell-side liquidity below prior daily lows remains a valid draw even after extended consolidation.
(Source: Episode 11)

Buy-side liquidity above relative equal highs serves as a primary draw during bullish expansions.
(Source: Episode 13)

Buy-side liquidity above prior relative highs remains a valid draw even after short-term consolidation.
(Source: Episode 14)

Sell-side liquidity commonly rests below the most recent short-term swing low immediately following a bullish structure shift.
(Source: Episode 15)

Liquidity may be taken before price delivers into an imbalance.
(Source: Episode 15)

Relative equal highs/lows remain valid liquidity pools even after partial runs earlier in the day.
(Source: Episode 16)

PM-session liquidity often forms from the most energetic AM-session swing.
(Source: Episode 16)

Previous daily highs and lows act as primary liquidity pools targeted by algorithms.
(Source: Episode 18)

Liquidity pools remain valid even after partial raids.
(Source: Episode 18)

Relative Equal Highs / Lows reaffirmed as primary, easiest-to-identify liquidity pools.

Old highs/lows remain valid regardless of partial raids.

(Source: Episode 19)

Relative equal highs and prior weekly highs act as high-probability liquidity pools.
(Source: Episode 20)

Liquidity runs may present as false breakouts when contradicted by intermarket context.
(Source: Episode 20)

Relative equal highs/lows on the daily timeframe serve as primary liquidity objectives.
(Source: Episode 21)

Liquidity objectives remain valid until clearly violated or fully displaced through.
(Source: Episode 21)

Relative equal highs and relative equal lows on the daily timeframe represent high-visibility liquidity pools frequently targeted by algorithms.
(Source: Episode 22)

Liquidity below relative equal lows often serves as the primary draw during bearish daily narratives.
(Source: Episode 22)

Sweep vs Run distinction:

Sweep: brief probe beyond a high/low followed by reversal back into range.

Run: price trades through a prior high/low and continues without immediate reversal.
(Source: Episode 23)

Relative equal highs are considered run targets when expansion is expected.
(Source: Episode 23)

Relative Equal Highs / Lows are the primary external liquidity objectives used to frame setups.
(Source: Episode 24)

Liquidity above relative equal highs is often targeted before bearish delivery.
(Source: Episode 24)

In a bearish bias, price typically seeks buy-side liquidity first (premium) before expanding toward sell-side liquidity (discount).
(Source: Episode 25)

Relative equal highs are commonly used as liquidity inducement prior to bearish expansion.
(Source: Episode 25)

Sell-side liquidity resting below prior daily lows serves as the offset pool for short positioning.
(Source: Episode 25)

Sell-side liquidity is considered “taken” when price trades below relative equal lows and does not immediately reclaim them.
(Source: Episode 26)

After sell-side liquidity is taken, buy-side liquidity above relative highs becomes the next primary draw, even when trading counter to the daily bias.
(Source: Episode 26)

A counter-trend move is often driven by external liquidity (e.g., relative equal highs) rather than trend continuation.
(Source: Episode 27)

Liquidity objectives do not need to be reached for a valid counter-trend expansion to occur.
(Source: Episode 27)

Relative Equal Highs on the daily timeframe serve as primary draw-on-liquidity levels when a bullish bias is present.
(Source: Episode 29)

Liquidity objectives may be framed days in advance and remain valid until reached or clearly invalidated.
(Source: Episode 29)

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Liquidity runs often precede reversals when aligned with higher-timeframe bias.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Breaks below relative equal lows often invite breakout participation that provides sell-side liquidity.
(Source: Episode 22 — CLEAR INFERENCE)

A lack of downside follow-through after sell-side is taken increases the likelihood of reversion toward buy-side liquidity.
(Source: Episode 26 — CLEAR INFERENCE)

Validity Conditions

Most relevant when price is consolidating or approaching prior highs/lows.

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

What This Concept Is NOT

Not buying/selling pressure.

Not supply and demand zones.

Not retail resistance or breakout confirmation.
(Source: Episode 20)

Liquidity runs are not entries by themselves.
(Source: Episode 24)

Not support/resistance.

Not retail breakout logic.
(Source: Episode 25)

Counter-trend liquidity draws are not trend reversals by default.
(Source: Episode 27)

Liquidity framing is not dependent on intraday volatility or constant participation.
(Source: Episode 29)

Ambiguities / Conflicts

Speaker rejects auction theory equivalence without formal definition.
