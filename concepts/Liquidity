Liquidity (Buy-Side / Sell-Side)
Canonical Definition

Liquidity refers to resting stop orders above prior highs (buy-side liquidity) and below prior lows (sell-side liquidity) that price is algorithmically drawn toward.

Identification Criteria

Prior swing highs indicate locations of buy stops.

Prior swing lows indicate locations of sell stops.

Consolidation followed by expansion increases probability of a liquidity draw.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Markets draw to one of two things: liquidity (stops) or imbalance.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Buy stops rest above old highs; sell stops rest below old lows.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Liquidity is engineered before large directional moves.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Sell-side liquidity below prior daily lows remains a valid draw even after extended consolidation.
(Source: Episode 11)

Buy-side liquidity above relative equal highs serves as a primary draw during bullish expansions.
(Source: Episode 13)

Buy-side liquidity above prior relative highs remains a valid draw even after short-term consolidation.
(Source: Episode 14)

Sell-side liquidity commonly rests below the most recent short-term swing low immediately following a bullish structure shift.
(Source: Episode 15)

Liquidity may be taken before price delivers into an imbalance.
(Source: Episode 15)

Relative equal highs/lows remain valid liquidity pools even after partial runs earlier in the day.
(Source: Episode 16)

PM-session liquidity often forms from the most energetic AM-session swing.
(Source: Episode 16)

Previous daily highs and lows act as primary liquidity pools targeted by algorithms.
(Source: Episode 18)

Liquidity pools remain valid even after partial raids.
(Source: Episode 18)

Relative Equal Highs / Lows reaffirmed as primary, easiest-to-identify liquidity pools.

Old highs/lows remain valid regardless of partial raids.

(Source: Episode 19)

Relative equal highs and prior weekly highs act as high-probability liquidity pools.
(Source: Episode 20)

Liquidity runs may present as false breakouts when contradicted by intermarket context.
(Source: Episode 20)

Relative equal highs/lows on the daily timeframe serve as primary liquidity objectives.
(Source: Episode 21)

Liquidity objectives remain valid until clearly violated or fully displaced through.
(Source: Episode 21)

Relative equal highs and relative equal lows on the daily timeframe represent high-visibility liquidity pools frequently targeted by algorithms.
(Source: Episode 22)

Liquidity below relative equal lows often serves as the primary draw during bearish daily narratives.
(Source: Episode 22)

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Liquidity runs often precede reversals when aligned with higher-timeframe bias.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 2)

Breaks below relative equal lows often invite breakout participation that provides sell-side liquidity.
(Source: Episode 22 — CLEAR INFERENCE)

Validity Conditions

Most relevant when price is consolidating or approaching prior highs/lows.

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

What This Concept Is NOT

Not buying/selling pressure.

Not supply and demand zones.

Not retail resistance or breakout confirmation.
