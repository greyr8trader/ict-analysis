Institutional Price Levels (Big Figures)
Canonical Definition

Institutional Price Levels are standardized price increments (notably big figures and their subdivisions) where liquidity commonly concentrates and price frequently reacts.

Identification Criteria

Sub-levels commonly referenced as 00, 20, 50, 80 within the big figure.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Big figures attract liquidity due to concentration of commercial and institutional activity.
