Internal Range Liquidity
Canonical Definition

Internal Range Liquidity refers to short-term liquidity pools (stops or imbalances) that form inside an existing price leg, as opposed to external range highs or lows.

Identification Criteria

Short-term swing highs or lows within a retracement.

Fair Value Gaps formed inside a larger price leg.

Relative equal highs/lows internal to the session range.

Explicit Rules (From Sources)

Internal range liquidity consists of short-term highs or lows inside a price leg that contain buy-side or sell-side stops.

Internal liquidity is often targeted after an external liquidity run.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

Internal range liquidity can be identified using the most recent low-to-high range, even when external session highs/lows are not in play.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Relative equal highs or lows within the current range qualify as internal liquidity targets.

Implied Conditions (Clearly Inferred)

Internal range liquidity provides intermediate objectives during intraday delivery.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 3)

Relative equal highs/lows formed repeatedly indicate retail positioning and buildup of internal liquidity.
(Source: Episode 5)

Three-drive patterns contribute to internal liquidity formation.

Validity Conditions

Internal range liquidity is evaluated after defining the current range using the most recent significant low and high.
(Source: 2022 ICT Mentorship — Episode 4)

Requires a clearly defined external range or prior impulse leg.

Invalidation / Failure Conditions

Not explicitly defined in available sources.

What This Concept Is NOT

Not external session highs or lows.

Not higher-timeframe liquidity pools.

Ambiguities / Conflicts

No formal hierarchy between internal liquidity types (stops vs imbalance).
