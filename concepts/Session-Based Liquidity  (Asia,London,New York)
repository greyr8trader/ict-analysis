Session-Based Liquidity (Asia / London / New York)
Canonical Definition

Session-Based Liquidity refers to the highs and lows formed during defined trading sessions that act as liquidity pools.
Session-Based Liquidity describes how liquidity objectives and price delivery can differ between the New York AM session and the New York PM session, allowing for multiple valid setups within a single trading day.
