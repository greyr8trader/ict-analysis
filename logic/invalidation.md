INVALIDATION RULES (ONE CLEAR CONDITION)

Purpose:
- Invalidation defines where the current idea is proven wrong.
- It must be objective and derived from RULEBOOK concepts (price/structure).

Hard Rules:
- Always output EXACTLY ONE invalidation condition.
- The invalidation must be:
  - a specific price level, OR
  - a specific structural condition defined in the RULEBOOK.
- Avoid vague language (e.g., “if momentum fades”, “if it looks weak”).
- Avoid multi-layer invalidations (do not list multiple levels/conditions).
- Invalidation must be consistent with the stated bias and timeframe context.

Guidance:
- Prefer the most direct “idea failure” point:
  - the price level that negates the HTF narrative, OR
  - the structural level that invalidates the confirmed MSS intent.
- If M15 is INVALID (NO TRADE), invalidation may be omitted or stated as:
  “No valid setup → no execution invalidation.”

Formatting Constraint:
- State the invalidation as a single bullet or single sentence.
